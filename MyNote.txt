So far this is what I've included

First Stage:

I need to create a python script to do the first initialization

This script should be able to reset even existing installation

The script should load a config file, if no config file provided, it will ask couple of questions and generate the config file

some of the question I have in my mind

- Name of the datacenter

- Number of Consul Nodes Requried, should be multiple choice of 1,3 or 5

- Number of Vault Servers Required, Should be choice of 0,2 or 3

- it will ask for the name of network interface (optional)

- it will ask for each ip for each node

After All questions, a "nodes.config.json" file will be generated


Second Stage:

The script will do the following

- It will first login into each server and stop any consul/vault service running

- it will generate a unique key,using consul binary, for gosip protocol

- it will send consul binary to each node, make folders, fix permissions, create user consul, etc..

- it will generate service file

- it will generate the default config.hcl file for consul servers nodes


- By Default, Connect, ACL will be enabled in the config file, but we are not setting any Master or Agent Token
  We will use Consul API to do these
  for ACL, all servers will have default policy of "deny", and extend-cache

- Start Each node Consul Server, so the first bootstrap can run, starting servers should be in sequence

- it will run on the first node: consul acl bootstrap > Master.Token
  This command we can only run it one time after the initial bootstrap.
  We cannot re-run this command unless restart all init process all over
  we are saving the in Master.Token file, so we can copy the file to the host system doing the confiuration
  (We have to decide later if we are going to keep this file in safe place, or we are deleting it, no idea yet)
